# Axios With Redux Toolkit

A working example of using Redux Toolkit with Axios when fetching data in React to get up to date 
Covid statistics by country from an external API.

You'll need your own RapidAPI account and API key, as well as a host URL for the Covid19 Data API (provided here)

```
X_RAPIDAPI_HOST=covid-19-data.p.rapidapi.com
X_RAPIDAPI_KEY=*Your RapidAPI key*
```

## To get Started

```
npm install

npm start
```
